• Teste de Bechdel não consegue investigar completamente todas as desigualdades nos filmes e na mídia.


• De acordo com o Centro de Estudos sobre a Mulher na Televisão e no Cinema da Universidade do Estado de San Diego, apenas 16% das mulheres são diretoras ou produtoras (2013).


• O teste de Bechdel somente mede o que as mulheres falam uma para a outra; ele não mede quais são suas ocupações, o que estão vestindo, seu personagem no filme como um todo ou qualquer outro fator definidor do personagem. Para que haja empoderamento de gênero, os testes precisam ir além da superfície dos personagens femininos (suas conversas) e olhar mais a fundo no personagem para servir de vitrine para vários tipos diferentes de representação feminina.";
