"ImpactIndustry" = "In 1985, the Bechdel Test impacted a lot inside of a little board that shows a discussion about its parameters. However, over time, the Test received criticism like:

The Test Bechdel can’t investigate all the inequality in movies and media.

According to the Study Center about the Woman in the Television and in the Cinema, in the San Diego State University, only 16% of women are directors or producer (2013).

The Bechdel Test just measure what women say to each other; it doesn’t measure her positions, her clothing, her character in the movie or any other factor that defines the character.

To ensure the gender empowerment, the tests need to go beyond the surface of female characters and look deeper into the characters to serve as a showcase to many different types of female representation.'
